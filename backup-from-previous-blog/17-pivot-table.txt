Excel for Actuaries #17 – PivotTables
Posted on January 11, 2014 by Benson	

Pivot tables (pronounced as /ˈpɪvət/) are commonly used tools to obtain a summary of some data. This handy tool allows creating reports easily. Yet it comes with cost.
Advantages of Pivot Tables

    Pivot tables can create summaries quickly with desired dimensions and filters, which can be adjusted easily.
    It takes a short period of time to generate pivot tables, when compared with using formulas for the same purpose. [Select cell range, Alt+D+P+F]
    Operations such as Sum, Count, Average of values can be obtained.

    Pivot Tables can be used as the basis for charts (2007 version onwards)

    Pivot Tables can take input from various sources including worksheet data, databases (Access / Oracle) or OLAP cube

Disadvantages of Pivot Tables

    Pivot Tables does not refresh automatically upon changes in underlying data. It requires manual refresh [Right Click + R].
    With the need of manual refresh, there is no guarantee on the correctness of pivot table results.
    The layout (positions of items) in a pivot table can change due to alterations in dimension attributes and report filters.
    Other formula does not auto-adjust when the positions of items change. (While the default Pivot Table formula GETPIVOTDATA has a clumsy syntax and requires the values to be visible)
    There are no easy ways to add all columns to the pivot table at once. VBA is the only solution.
    Hidden elements can exist in a pivot table which are more difficult to check and understand. Examples are calculated items and group items.

Tips on using Pivot Tables

    The use of pivot tables is consistent with the principle of putting all the same kind of data in one single worksheet (e.g. lapsed policies of each month: Pivot table can be created and the monthly trend can be seen easily).

    Classic PivotTable Layout is often more useful. (Right Click + O + Shift Tab + left/right arrow keys + Alt+L)

    Since Excel 2010 version, it is possible to show all repeated item labels. This allow easier post-processing using formulas. (Alt + J + Y + P + R)

    The file size of an Excel file can be reduced by turning off “Save Data With Table Layout” option. This will speed up the saving process and reduce the file size but slow down the refresh speed.

    Unchecking "Save Source Data With File" can reduce file size

    Avoid multiple pivot tables on the same worksheet. Putting multiple pivot tables together may lead to collision which needs resolutions.
    When a filter in the pivot table is applied to select only certain values, Excel does not automatically select any newly appeared items upon refresh.
    All historical values are retained in the filters even if they are absent in the latest refresh. To avoid it, go to “PivotTable Options” => “Data” Tab => set “Retain items deleted from the data source” to “None”.

Related Hotkeys

The Right-click hotkeys can be invoked when the active cell is on a Pivot Table. For the hotkeys about filtering, please refer to the article about Filters (not written yet).

Conclusion – Pivot Tables: To use, or not to use?

    While pivot table is a powerful tool, Excel’s limitation makes it less powerful than it could be.
    If pivot table is used, please make sure relevant checks are included to ensure the consistency between the pivot table results and the underlying data.
    If the dimensions of interest are not likely to change and the number of required cells are not large, one can consider using plain Excel formula (SUMIF, COUNTIF) instead of pivot tables. This can eliminate the shortcomings of using PivotTables.
