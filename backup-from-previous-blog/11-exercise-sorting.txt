Answer

Points to note:

    A policy-by-policy full scan for matching 40000 policies with 60000 policies will take, on average, 40000 * 30000 = 1.2 billion comparisons, which make calculation time very slow.
    By sorting on the 60000 policies, we can utilize the sorted match feature (binary search-like algorithm), where the number of comparisons can be reduced to approximately 40000 * log 60000 / log 2 = 634,907 comparisons. It will be much faster.
    Using VLOOKUP instead of MATCH will double (or even triple) the number of matching needed. In such case VLOOKUP will search for the same policy number in the same policy number list for at least twice, one for age and one for sex. It also doubles or triples the calculation time.
    We should only MATCH once for each policy only. After obtaining the matched row number, we can use it with INDEX to obtain the corresponding age and sex of the policy without the need to search again.
    By sorting the 60000 policies and using INDEX+MATCH functions, the calculation can be completed instantly.

Certainly an Excel file speaks better:
