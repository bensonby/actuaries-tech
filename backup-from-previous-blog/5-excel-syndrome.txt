The Excel Syndrome

Excel has changed our logical mind. Some of the impacts are negative. We all have somehow been “polluted” by Excel – its ease of use. Below I listed some symptoms of “The Excel Syndrome”. (Note that these statements may not be the full generalization of the picture. But at least these are possible symptoms)

    You manage all sort of data in Excel, in a table format – whether it is related to numbers or not.
    You use Excel as a calculator, a database, a layout engine, a simple graph/flowchart drawing software, a text editor and a programming environment with VBA.
    If you have a 100-line string and want to add a comma to the end of each line, you open Excel for this task without hesitation.
    You are used to reading statements like (I7+D8-E8)*((1+$B$3)^(1/12)-1) and you find it somehow odd to read statements like (ending_bal[t-1]+premium[t]-commission[t])*((1+int_rate)^(1/12)-1).
    You treat filling down formula and refreshing pivot table as very normal editing procedures we should perform.
    You have tried to create an entire layout of information (which consists of large amount of text) using Excel, e.g. policy illustrations.
    You have experienced the problem of not having enough number of rows in Excel.
    You think you know programming because you are capable of using VBA to automate Excel.
    You think Excel + VBA is very powerful – so powerful that you don’t need other programming language, or Excel + VBA is enough for any purpose.
    You have learnt programming with Excel + VBA, and not any other programming languages.
    You view a date as a number of days.
    You have ever seen “Calculating (X processors): 1%” in the status bar of Excel.
    You believe that a database table can be referenced by the column number (thank to VLOOKUP).
    Q: Need to solve a problem? A: Build an Excel spreadsheet! (whether it is a simple file log, a calendar, etc.)
    You think that the logic in Excel can be understood more easily when compared with the logic written in a programming language.
    You have ever created an Excel file of size larger than 50 MB.
    You put all input parameters in one worksheet.

p.s. You are welcome to suggest more!
