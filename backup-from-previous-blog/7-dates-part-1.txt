Excel for Actuaries #7 – About Dates (Part 1)

Introduction

Dates are special in Excel… and are worth discussing. In this article, I will explain the basics of dates in Excel and some common methods to process dates.
Dates are numbers

Some of you may not know this fact: Dates are just numbers in Excel.

The date 31-12-2011 is equivalent to the number 40908, i.e. the display “31-12-2011″ is a format setting for the number 40908, just like you apply format to change it to 4090800%, or 40,908. This number represents the number of days since 1/1/1900. Such number is called a “serial number” in Excel.

Keyboard Shortcut Tips: Press Ctrl+Shift+3 to set a cell to be in date format; and Ctrl+Shift+~ for general number format.

The basic way to create a date through formula is by using =DATE(2011, 10, 31). But you may not know this: =DATE(2010, 14, 1) and =DATE(2011, 3, -1) also work. Try it! A simple question for you: which date does =DATE(2012, 0, 0) represent?

Other date creation functions include DATEVALUE and TODAY.
Arithmetics on dates

As you know dates are equivalent to numbers representing the number of days since 1/1/1900, you will find it easy to apply simple arithmetics.

You subtract one date from another to find the number of days between; You add a date by 7 to arrive at the same day next week. You often need more complicated calculation, don’t you? DATEDIF is what you must know.
The useful function: DATEDIF

According to Pearson Software Consulting, this function has long been available in Excel – since the earliest version of Excel you have worked on, but it has not been well documented and thus not many of us know.

DATEDIF calculate the differences in number of years/months/days given two dates. You can refer to the DATEDIF page at Pearson Software Consulting for more details and examples.

Usage: =DATEDIF(date1, date2, interval) (date1 has to be earlier than date2, otherwise a #NUM! error is returned)

Below are some examples (Notice how it ignores the problem with the end of the month!):

The most useful application of DATEDIF is to find the current age of a person given the birth date.
=DATEDIF(DateOfBirth, TODAY(), "y")

Note: As seen from the examples, great care should be taken when using “ym”, “yd” or “md” as the interval.

Date Format

The display of the date can be adjusted by “Format Cells” (Ctrl+1) -> “Date”. There are several preset formats available for you to choose.

If none of them suit your needs, you can select “Custom” and enter your own “formatting code” to control how the date is displayed.

You can find the details of possible formatting code in ozgrid.
Conclusion

    Dates are numbers representing the number of days since 1/1/1900
    Make good use of the arithmetic functions and the DATEDIF function. Don’t create long and stupid date formula in Excel again.
