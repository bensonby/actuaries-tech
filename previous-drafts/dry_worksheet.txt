DRY in worksheet formula

The DRY principle applies to cell formula as well.
[Exhibit 1]
=IF(A1=3, VLOOKUP($D$1, data!$A$1:$BZ$2400, 35, FALSE), VLOOKUP($D$1, data!$A$1:$BZ$2400, 36, FALSE))
[Exhibit 2]
=VLOOKUP($D$1, data!$A$1:$BZ$2400, IF(A1=3, 35, 36), FALSE)

The improved formulae is shorter, easier to understand and conforms to the DRY principle. Whenever the data range (data!$A$1:$BZ$2400) is changed, only one modification is necessary in Exhibit 2 instead of two in Exhibit 1.

if(iserror(vlookup), 0, vlookup)

vlookup on a column where there are a lot of repeated cobsecutive value , determine if same vAalue to eliminate vlookup

a hardcoded number in formula also considered dry, because you have to manually fill down the formula - this action is equivalent to a replace in nature.
