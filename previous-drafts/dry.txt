Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
The first principle in programming

Most of the people who know to write VBA do not know how to write good VBA code. A very basic law in programming is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). Code snippets like the one shown in Exhibit 1-a)? are not uncommon. Perhaps the writer is lazy to think or the writer thinks it is easy to understand.
But it is no good at all.
Flaws when you repeat yourself often:
1. It is more difficult to modify the program. "Replace" function may not always do the job
2. It is more difficult to read because the code is long and clumsy
3. A slight modification may require a large number of modifications in different VBA modules

We all want code that is one variable for all. The simplest relevant example is the worksheet's name or ID. Go and have a look at your recent macro, how many times the name or ID (e.g. "Sheet1") is repeated?

The same principle applies to multiple statements (Example 3, 4)

Example: worksheet name keeps repeating
Example: looping, value = i & "_" & j & "_1" appears many times
Example: copy different ranges -> paste transpose
Example: for all worksheets, delete the first row and insert a new row between 2nd and 3rd
