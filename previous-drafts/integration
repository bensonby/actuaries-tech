basic of substitution and by parts

e: 3 cases
trigo: degree n, linear combination, product to sum, t = tan x/2, tanx or cotx - simple substitution, 
ln: by substututiin for ln x / x, other cases by parts
polynomials: use basic degree formula ( note on degree -1 to ln) or expand all or by parts for more complicated function. also a pseudopolynomial in cos x
polynomial plus x in denominator: improper function - partial fractions (even sqrt) - matching denominator for substitution - completing the square and change x,- plug formula for arc tan
sqrt: simplest: usual formula. comvination with polynomial- factor to the thing inside sqrr, quadratic sqrt at denominator - substitutin sin or sec or tan,  
arcsin, etc - by parts
sin or cos with eï¼š by parts twice to become itself
