Layout mixed with logic:

have to fill down formula
-> change in reference

------------------------

Calculation

Manual calculation due to slowness, which is due to poor formula

Links -> manual update of links?
modifying linked cells --> update only when opening at the same time

data table: unstable, no indicator of finished or not

p.s. Checks? it means we all agree that Excel is easy to have errors

------------------------------------------

Excel Syndrome
You treat repeating things e.g. copying formula, is normal and is what you have to do
You think macro is equivalent to program
You are more used to / prefer reading (B2+B3)/2/1000*C3*$G$1 to (sa[t-1]+sa[t])/2/1000*prem_rate[t]*loading
You use Excel for formatting and layout, e.g. Policy Illustrations
You think VBA / Excel is powerful, because of what it can do or whatever..
(no.. the syntax is horrible, no full OOP ffeatures, no MVC.. it is VB not VBA.
  -- we need to learn others, and read others for polishing)
You use excel as a calculator (R is definitely better)
You use excel to type simple notes / remarks
To you, a date/time value means the number of days

=-----------------------------------------------
Comments
Commenting person cannot be hidden..
Copying comment -> the original commentor
comment triangle not visible when filtering is on / background color is similar
Hard to locate all comments in workbook (the "Special" feature is not helpful enough)
Layout bug of comments in case of frozen pane

-------------------------------------------------
Why easy to have errors?
Pivot table upon data update -> need to refresh / change data range
New data added -> need to fill formula / modify reference range
Cell deleted -> changed to REF! Error
Use links -> external file source changed / moved / deleted

-------------------------------------------
slow calculations
vlookuup with false: slow

--------------------------------------------
Macro vs Program...
to be continued..

------------------------------------------------

Use of VBA: minimal
Due to
1. we are not technically equipped (not meaning incapable of writing program that works, but incapable of writing good codes)
2. excel's poor response upon errors - 1004? 400? Hard to debug
   but as far as i see no VBA program does error handlings / data validation to a good extent
3. Hard to trace - it leaves no trajector on the working when most of the output will not be in formula (if formula works, no need for VBA)
   VBA can override anything in the worksheet.

After considering these, in my experience there are 2 common tasks that will be accomplished by VBA
1. As a data table
Although excel has a data table functionality. It is unstable and unreliable and will fail when the amount of inputs are large.
VBA is used for a better "data table" feature.
In the usual case, we have lots of policies but only a single reserve calculator which can handle only one policy at a time
2. Opening multiple files to extract content
There are times when we want to extract pieces of information from multiple workbooks and worksheets, e.g. There is an monthly excel file storing the inforce policy information of a particular plan.
-- One possible way is to use indirect but it is not preferred - as mentioned in the previous article ###. A VBA program will perform better given that the format of ....

My opening multiple file library:
- prevent any prompt on password, etc. error handling
- omit 2nd column t oget all worksheets
Implement functions for get_next_wb()

My data table VBA library:
Purpose
Data table is an excel built-in function which.. (according to official). However the function does not work stably and will fail when the amount of data or calculation is large. It also gives no progress info during calculation. Personally I have experienced issues of data table not fully completed, leading to erroroneous result. Therefore a simple VBA function is written to improve it.

Applications
The applications of data table in the actuarial tasks are quite common, e.g. reserve calculation of policies, pricing result of policies, valuation of investment assets, etc. (ask alvin for more examples)
