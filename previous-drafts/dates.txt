Dates
A1. Dates are numbers
Some of you may not know this fact: Dates are just numbers in Excel.
[Exhibit: date view + number view (number - date = 0)]
The date 31-12-2011 is equivalent to the number ?????, i.e. the display "31-12-2011" is a format setting for the number ?????. This number represents the number of days since ?. (Press Ctrl+Shift+3 to set a cell to be in date format; and Ctrl+Shift+~ for general number format).

The basic way to create a date is to use DATE(2011, 10, 31). But you may not know this: DATE(2010, 14, 1) and DATE(2011, 3, -1) also work. Try it! A simple question for you: which date does DATE(2012, 0, 0) represent?

B. the useful function: DATEDIF
DATEDIF: the useful function
DATEDIF calculate the differences in number of years/months/days given two dates. Examples are shown at the right.
=DATEDIF(date1, date2, interval)
date1 has to be earlier than date2

The other possible values for the last arguments are "m", "d", "ym", "yd", "md". ... Examples are shown at the right.
(This function is available starting from 2000 version)

C. Examples of Date Processing:
Get the month end of a given date.
Get the next month end given a month end
Get the quarter (1 to 4) which a given date belongs to
Get the number of months between 2 month ends
...?

D. Date Format
The display of the date can be adjusted by "Format Cells" (Ctrl+1) -> "Custom". Here a "format string" is used to control how the date is displayed.
With the date 8th June 2011, below shows the possible formats:
d 8
dd 08
m 6
mm 06
mmm Jun
yy 11
yyyy 2011
(and more?)
not suggested.. hide thw day imfo foe loojup

Use any combinations of the above to achieve what you need.

E. Default Date Format

The default date format used is usually either mm/dd/yyyy or dd-MMM-yy (unless manually modified).
Some of us, being used to the date format of dd/mm/yyyy, may want to reverse the order of dd and mm in the default format.

How to change?
This is a system-wide settings. ...... (instructions)

Issues with the change
You have to follow the system date format when entering a date in Excel. (If the format is set as mm/dd/yyyy, you can only enter 12/31/2011 in the cell, but not 31/12/2011)
Opening existing excel files (.xls, .xlsx, .xlsm) with dates are alright. However when excel reads csv, the parsing of dates follow the default date format.
  a. For example, when the default format is mm/dd/yyyy, opening a csv containing "08/06/2011" will be interpreted by Excel as 6th August 2011. For the other case when the format is dd/mm/yyyy, opening the same file will give the date 8th June 2011.
  b. When the default format is mm/dd/yyyy, when opening a csv having the date "27/06/2011", Excel will fail to parse the date and it turns out to interpret 27/06/2011 as a text.
Tips for the solution
If the format has the month and day order unfortunately reversed, it has to be converted. Below shows a screenshot for the adjustment formula.
Another way is to use the text delimiting function.

How to avoid such problem? The date format depends on system settings on each computer, thus I suggest avoiding this risk by:
1. use the number yyyymmdd to represent a date
2. always use the format dd-mmm-yy when savinf into csv (method to do?)
3. always store unto csv using the raw number of the date, not recommended as it is not intuitively readable

F. how about time?

not commonly used
be careful of time zone difference
always include a time zone e.g. UTC+8 to indicate the correct time to be recognized worldwide.

show both date and time in cell format..
how?

use yyyymmdd as date to eliminate all problems

G. formula including dates
Dates as text
From time to time you will need to create sentences such as "Balance Sheet as of 31-MAR-2013", where the date comes from another cell having the input date 3/31/2013.
Assuming the date is stored in cell A1, the formula ="Balance Sheet as of "&A1 will give "Balance Sheet as of xxxxx", because the formula includes the date using its value, i.e. its serial number. (Recall that the date displayed is merely a format setting of the serial number)
To include the date in the desired format, it has to be: UPPER(TEXT(A1, "dd-mmm-yyyy")

Dates as key for lookup
Using the date as a key for lookup
never just use the serial number!!
