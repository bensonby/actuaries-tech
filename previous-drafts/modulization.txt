Modular Approach
The second programming principle

[Exhibit:
Sub Copy_inventory_data
    //result worksheets variable

    //excel set sys config

    //read inputs (worksheet names)
    //copy worksheets
    //restore sys config
End Sub
]

[Exhibit:
//modular approach
]

You probably have heard of the term "modular approach" before. But only few of non-engineering students understand its importance.
Exhibit A is the code without modulization (with some nice comments); Exhibit B is the code with modulization.
They both do the task correctly, but Exhibit 1b is much better, because of the following reasons.
1. (quote: check if correct) Good code is its own documentation (by ??)
The seemingly nice comments in Exhibit ? are unnecessary when you read Exhibit ?. That is why the above saying comes. From Exhibit B, one can clearly know what the Sub is going to do: the 3 steps which are in 3 different sub-functions. From now on, don't bother to write any more those comments by <b>modulizing your code</b> and <b>giving them a nice name</b>.
2. easier to maintain and read
Each function is only responsible for its own stuff which is defined tightly (example using above) single responsiblity principle?
It will be easier to read and understand by human because what the function does only specific things and will be shorter.
When it comes to the time modification, it is much easier because only a smaller portion of code needs to be considered
3. Reusable Code
The reusable part refers to the sub-functions you have created. An obvious example is the two functions "" and "" in Exhibit ?. They are easily reusable in any of your other VBA code.
3. Macroscopic view of the program code
Once the un-modulized)? code (Copy_inventory_data) becomes long, e.g. spanning 150 lines, the program code is not clear enough even though comments are present - simply because they are too far away from each other and require substantial scrolling.
By modulization, one can grasp the macroscopic view of the VBA procedure by reading the function names. Isn't it intuitive?
