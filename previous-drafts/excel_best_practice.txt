Best Practice in Excel
To make your workbooks easier to read

1. Distinguish between input cells with a different cell color

2. Distinguish between formula calculated by the workbook and calculated through and external file (links in Excel) with a different cell color

3. Establish good version control log of every workbook and maintain consistent file names for different versions (e.g. v01, v02 and so on)

4. Use proper worksheet names. Some people use worksheet colors but it is a feature not in pre-2003 versions therefore I do not recommend. Good worksheets names are more important.

5. Remove obsolete NAMES defined in Excel. Check all of them by pressing Ctrl+F3, you may be surprised to see all the #REF! there.

6. Avoid volatile functions (explained in the chapter "Volatile Functions")
