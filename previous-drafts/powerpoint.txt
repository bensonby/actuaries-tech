Powerpoint skills 
Most of us probably had some lessons on Powerpoint before in colleges.
 However those you learnt are often not what we should learn about presentations.
 
1. Powerpoint is for presentation, not as a document with paragraphs.

2. As few words as possible

3. Make sure the audience follow the agenda

4. Use slide master instead of slide-by-slide customizations

5. Use clip arts only when they accurately represent the ideas
2007 clip arts is boring
create custom ones

6. Utilize dual screen setup

7. Attachments (videos)


downloading attachments first, avoid connection to internet just for view of documents
notice on the font size and clarity, especially on attachments
know the correct way to switch to other pages in powerpoint
ensure the audience can follow the flow of your presentation, know where you are
-- although an agenda is shown, audience will forget it soon
-- even if you add the flow in every page, audience can get lost easily when you dig into sub-sections, sub-sub-sections and sub-sub-sub-sections
Whenever you use short forms or technical terms, make sure you have considered the audience's background. Explain clearly if necessary
Think about how people talk without presentation softwares. Powerpoint is not used to hold your content, but to ASSIST your presentation.
The content should be typed neatly using a word processor such as MS Word. Powerpoint is surely not for that purpose.
Do not embed videos in your presentation as it makes your powerpoint unnecessarily large. Videos should be shown separately
Do not include useless images, icons or photos. It makes no sense. Simple is beauty
