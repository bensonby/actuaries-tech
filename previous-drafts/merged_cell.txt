Merged Cells
- Avoid it!

Merged cells create the following problem:
1. Getting the error dialog during copy & paste or sorting
[image of the error] The operation requires the merged cells to be identically sized.

2. It becomes impossible to select a single column consisting of only part of a merged cell by keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Space)
[screenshot of the selction] With a merged cell present, the above selection cannot be done without the help of a mouse.

In most cases, we merge cells in order to align some text to the centre of multiple cells. The solution is to use "Centre across selection".

Select the range of cells, open the "Format Cells" dialog (Ctrl+1), and select "Centre Across Selection" in the Horizontal Text Alignment. (See the screenshot below).

As an illustration, below shows the outcomes of using merged cells and using "Centre Across Selection". Please use "Centre Across Selection" from now on.
